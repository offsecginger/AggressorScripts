# Submissions
Please feel free to submit a Pull Request with fixes or improvements to any of the existing scripts; however, my intention is to only keep Aggressor scripts that I've written in this repo.

If you have an idea for a script and would like to submit it somewhere, consider adding it to Lee Kagan's [Aggressor Scripts Collection](https://github.com/invokethreatguy/AggressorCollection) repo.
